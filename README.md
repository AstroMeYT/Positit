# Postit

## What is it?
Postit is a simple web-based application for communication, sort of like Discord or Matrix. It cannot relatively compete, because it is much
simpler than Discord or Matrix.

## What can it do?
Postit can join or create chatrooms, called Groups. As long as someone has the Group ID, they can join it, so keep your Group ID safe! You
can be in up to 5 Groups at a time. Each Group has no actual chat history. When you join a Group, you are just listening on the server for
a data packet to display.

## Is it private?
Yes, Postit is private. The server collects no personal data or telemetry, not even usage statistics. Additionally, all data, such as your
username and your joined Groups, are saved locally. The servers do not have access to that data.

## How can I use it?
Postit is deployed at https://astromeyt.github.io/Postit. The interface is made for 16:9 ratios, which will fit most laptops and monitors.
If it does not fit your screen, it will just resize itself non-dynamically. It will stay in 16:9.

## Version History
- v0.1 : Initial release. May be buggy.
